## Run the executables

Use the `generate_runs.py` script to setup launch scripts, launch jobs and collect results.
Use the `-h` option to see script options.

Meshes need to available in the `mesh_scripts` folder ( see docs in the code for details).
Mesh generation is not handled by this script.

```bash
source run_env/bin/activate
python generate_modules.py -h
```
